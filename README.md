# Garbage-Disposal-Management-System

Created a command line application using C++ and DS concepts in Visual Studio code. This project was done as part of the "Data Structures and Algorithms" course during my bachelor's. The application is used for Garbage disposal Management. It manages different types of waste collection and waste disposal data while giving appropriate secured access to various levels of employees in an organization

We have 3 types of employees or users here. 

1) 12 Workers
2) 2 Supervisors
3) 1 Manager

The spread sheet contains following 8 columns:
1) Date of entry 
2) Time of entry
3) User (W or S or M)
4) Waste collected (in pounds)
    a) Recycle
    b) Plastic
    c) Trash
6) Waste Disposed (in pounds)
    a) Recycle
    b) Plastic
    c) Trash
7) Missing (in pounds)
8) Approval (Approved or Not Approved)

All three users whenever they make an entry, the date and time of entry is recorded.

Workers can only enter Data for Waste collected. Also they dont have access to previous entries.

Supervisors have access to all data, can make changes to previously made entries, except that they cannot change the Approval status of an entry.

Manager can have access to all data and is the only one who can approve an entry. The manager can also change the previous entries.

Also once the entry is approved, no one can change it again.
